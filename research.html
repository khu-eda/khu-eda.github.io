    <h2>Research Overview</h2>
    <p>
      The <strong>AI‑aided Design Automation (AIDA) Lab</strong> investigates next‑generation methods for automating and optimizing electronic design. 
	  Our work combines machine learning, optimization, and circuit design principles to tackle challenges in design productivity, quality, and scalability.
    </p>
    <p>
      We focus on three core areas: (1) integrating AI into the Electronic Design Automation (EDA) flow, (2) design and technology co-optimization, and (3) developing robust physical design methodologies for advanced semiconductor nodes.

          <h3>AI-aided Design Automation</h3>
          <p>
            We develop intelligent algorithms that learn from past designs data to guide decision-making in both digital/analog design.
			Our approaches enable faster convergence to optimized solutions with fewer design iterations.

          <h3>Design and Technology Co-Optimization (DTCO)</h3>
          <p>
            DTCO is essential for pushing the limits of modern semiconductor design. 
			We co-optimize standard cell architectures and physical constraints with technology-specific rules and capabilities.
